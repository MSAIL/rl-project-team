# MSAIL Deep Reinforcement Learning Project

This is a brief guide for deep reinforcement learning projects in MSAIL 2020-2021.

## Set Up
We'll be using OpenAI's Gym environment for this project. 

1. [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) - The Gym main website
2. [OpenAI Gym Github Repo](https://github.com/openai/gym) - The Raw code of Gym in Github
3. [OpenAI Gym Documentation](http://gym.openai.com/docs/) - Documentation, with installation instruction

## Resources
* [Deeplizard RL Module](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv) - some combination of theory and OpenAI Gym
* [Deep Reinforcement Learning Series (Jonathan Hui)](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-deep-reinforcement-learning-series-833319a95530) - A deep RL series on Medium that covers a lot of important topics (DQNs, Policy Gradients, etc)
* [Deep RL Course](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/) - A series with a more implementation heavy approach: they teach Deep RL concepts through implementing agents for different games (Space Invaders, Doom, Sonic)

More Resources: All of these Github repos have links to a ton of useful RL content (other tutorials, courses, textbooks, blog posts, research papers, etc)
* [Roboserg Repo](https://github.com/roboserg/rl)
* [Dennybritz Repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
* [Aikorea Repo](https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl)
